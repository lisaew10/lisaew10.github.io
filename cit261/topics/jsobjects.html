<h1>Object-oriented Programming</h1>
<p>From w3schools: </br> In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

    Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Dates are always objects
    Maths are always objects
    Regular expressions are always objects
    Arrays are always objects
    Functions are always objects
    Objects are always objects
    All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.</p>

    <h1>Week 1</h1>

        <p>Week 01: 9/16 - 9/21
            Returning to the discussion boards, meeting for office hours on Thursday evening, and GitHub was rewarding
            and stressful. Changed my username on GitHub. Updated my GitHub website name. Found this wonderful GUI app,
            GitKraken. I mean even the name is pretty cool. I do not have a good understanding of how to put it to use
            but I am excited to get to know more. The layout of this class seems a bit odd. A lot of reading and
            searching on my own. Teaching peers and listening to peers. I hope I get something out of the class.
            I feel like I communicated well. I did show up to office hours even though I needed to leave early. I took
            part in the discussion boards.
